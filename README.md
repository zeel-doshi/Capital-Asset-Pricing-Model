# Capital-Asset-Pricing-Model
# Overview

This project focuses on utilizing the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate expected returns for risky assets, construct the Capital Market Line (CML), and evaluate portfolio performance using various performance measures. The analysis includes both theoretical calculations and practical application to real or hypothetical asset portfolios.

# Project Objectives

    Estimate Expected Returns: Utilize the CAPM formula to calculate the expected return for 
    each of the selected risky assets based on their beta values and the risk-free rate.

    Construct Capital Market Line (CML): Use the CAPM model to derive the equation for the CML, 
    which represents the optimal risk-return trade-off for a portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset.

    Plot Efficient Frontier and CML: Graphically represent the efficient frontier, which illustrates the set of optimal
    portfolios that maximize expected return for a given level of risk, along with the CML. 
    This visualization helps in understanding the risk-return characteristics of the portfolio.

    Identify Tangency Point: Identify the tangency point on the efficient frontier where the CML touches it. 
    Discuss the significance of this point, which represents the optimal portfolio that balances risk and return, 
    taking into account both risky assets and the risk-free asset.
